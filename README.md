# Workout-tracker

## Description
This app charts workouts done by a user.  They are able to "add" a workout for resistance or cardio on both the "Continue Workout" and the "Add Workout" buttons (Don't know why that is, it was a code givien to me for a homework assignment).  The "Last Workout" page will tally the amount of time, reps, and other info about pertaining to the inputed workout.  The dashboard charts the workouts in 2 graphs.
